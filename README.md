# My TUBE Project

### Hi Everyone, in this project i've built a clone of youtube using MERN stack, firebase to store files that i want to upload to the website and i've containerized the project using docker.  For the registation two options are offered, the first is manually by filling personal infos, the second one is using GoogleAuth. Many features have been implemented such as light mode page, subscriptions page where only videos of account you've subscribed to appear,like/dislike options and more...   You can try it by yourself by using the docker image and run port 3000. :)
