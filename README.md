# :rocket: My TUBE Project :rocket:

### Hi Everyone, in this project i've built a clone of youtube using MERN stack, firebase to store files that i want to upload to the website and i've containerized the project using docker. <br /> For the registation two options are offered, the first is manually by filling personal infos, the second one is using GoogleAuth.<br />Many features have been implemented such as light mode page, subscriptions page where only videos of account you've subscribed to appear, videos recommendations by keyword, like/dislike options and more...<br />You can try it by yourself by using the docker image and run port 3000. :slightly_smiling_face:
